# The RanksPeriod operation returns historical ranks from a
# single ranking system for multiple dates between the Start
# and End dates. The Ranking system can be specified directly
# in the script or use existing ranking systems created using
# the website.

# This example is from a 20-year test, run quarterly, that
# ranks all the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials according
# to their yield. There is an old stockpicking strategy that
# selects the ten Dow Jones stocks with the highest yield,
# and this script tells you what they are each quarter, along
# with how all the other stocks in the Dow ranked.
