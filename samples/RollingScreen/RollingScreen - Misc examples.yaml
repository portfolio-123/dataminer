# A rolling screen backtest means that the screen backtest is first
# run on the first Saturday after the Start Date and the stocks are
# held for the number of days specified as the Holding Period. Then
# the screen backtest is run again using a start date that is either
# 1 week or 4 weeks in the future as specified by the Frequency. This
# continues until tests have been run for the entire period between
# the specified Start Date and End Date.
#
# This example creates a custom universe and runs rolling screen
# backtests for several ranking systems and alters the number of 
# stocks held.
