# A rolling screen backtest means that the screen backtest is first
# run on the first Saturday after the Start Date and the stocks are
# held for the number of days specified as the Holding Period. Then
# the screen backtest is run again using a start date that is either
# 1 week or 4 weeks in the future as specified by the Frequency. This
# continues until tests have been run for the entire period between
# the specified Start Date and End Date.
#
# This is a rolling screen backtest of 3 ranking systems we offer,
# "Core: Growth" and "Core: Value". It divides the S&P 500 universes
# into five random subuniverses and then tests a 367-day holding
# period, tested every four weeks between 2007 and 2020, for the top
# and bottom deciles of each ranking system.
