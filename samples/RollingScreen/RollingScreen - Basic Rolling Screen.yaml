# A rolling screen backtest means that the screen backtest is first
# run on the first Saturday after the Start Date and the stocks are
# held for the number of days specified as the Holding Period. Then
# the screen backtest is run again using a start date that is either
# 1 week or 4 weeks in the future as specified by the Frequency. This
# continues until tests have been run for the entire period between
# the specified Start Date and End Date.
#
# This basic example creates a custom universe by adding a rule to our
# Prussell2000 universe. Then it runs the backtest for a single ranking
# system. The backtest covers 20 years and tests are run for rolling dates 
# 4 weeks apart with 20 stocks held for 3 months in each interation.
