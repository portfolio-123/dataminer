# This operation allows you to download current or historical
# ranks for multiple ranking systems for a single date. The
# Ranking system can be specified directly in the script or you
# can use existing ranking systems. It is like using a screen
# with an unlimited number of "Rating" commands.

# The example below returns the ranks from 6 different ranking
# systems which are based on different investing styles and one
# ranking system that is a combination of those 6. It uses the
# Dow stocks as the universe.
