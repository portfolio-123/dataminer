# Screens allow you to filter a universe of stocks or ETFs based on the
# rules you provide. The ScreenRun operation in DataMiner has all the same
# capabilities as the screener on the website including the option
# of incorporating a ranking system into the screen and running screens
# that are either long, long/short or hedged.
#
# This example is a long/short screen which:
#  - Creates a universe consisting of reasonable liquid non-ADR Technology stocks. 
#  - Ranks the stocks in this universe based on the Core: Momentum ranking system.
#  - Pick 5 'Long' stocks which are the highest ranked stocks that are also in
#    the top 50% of Tech stocks based on Price to Sales ascending (ie cheap stocks).
#  - Pick 5 'Short' stocks which are the lowest ranked stocks that are also in the
#    lowest 50% of Tech stocks based on Price to Sales ascending (ie expensive stocks).
