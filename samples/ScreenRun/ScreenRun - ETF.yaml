# Screens allow you to filter a universe of stocks or ETFs based on the
# rules you provide. The ScreenRun operation in DataMiner has all the same
# capabilities as the screener on the website including the option
# of incorporating a ranking system into the screen and running screens
# that are either long, long/short or hedged.
#
# This example finds the 5 Tech sector ETFs with the highest returns for 
# the last year. It filters out any leveraged ETFs.
