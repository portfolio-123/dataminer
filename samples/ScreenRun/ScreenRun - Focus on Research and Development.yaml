# Screens allow you to filter a universe of stocks or ETFs based on the rules you provide. The ScreenRun operation
# in DataMiner has all the same capabilities as the screener on the website including the option of incorporating
# a ranking system into the screen and running screens that are either long, long/short or hedged.

# This example of the ScreenRun operation is based on the 'Focus on R&D' screen which can be found on the website.
# The website has a detailed description of the reasoning behind the screen, but the summary is companies with high 
# R&D to equity market value earn large excess future returns.
# The screen begins with the Russell 3000 and eliminates companies in industries that seldom report R&D expenses 
# or whose R&D expenses are relatively irrelevant to their future performance.
# We then impose the rule that the companies have to spend 15% of their equity market value on R&D.
# Next, we eliminate companies that have strong short interest as those are the most likely to have significant problems.
# Lastly, we eliminate companies whose growth has been poor by using one of our core ranking systems.
