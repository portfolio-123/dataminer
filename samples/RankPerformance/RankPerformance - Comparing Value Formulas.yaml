# This operation runs multiple bucket performance tests of multi-factor ranking
# systems. You can use an existing ranking system that we offer or a ranking system 
# that you have created on the website. It is also possible to define the ranking
# system within the DataMiner script. Other settings include the number of buckets,
# the rebalance period, and the starting universe. The DataMiner output includes
# many more statistics than what the website offers. To collect these stats, DataMiner
# runs a screen backtest for each bucket.
#
# In this example, the universe is defined within the DataMiner script. There are 5
# iterations with each one testing a different value factor. To accomplish this, 
# each iteration has a ranking system consisting of a single formula. We call this a
# 'Quick Rank'. The different methods of defining a ranking system within the DataMiner
# script can be found in setting_rankings.yaml in the DataMiner reference files and in
# the "Inline Ranking System" folder in Samples.
