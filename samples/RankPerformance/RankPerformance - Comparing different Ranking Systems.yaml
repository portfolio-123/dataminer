# This operation runs multiple bucket performance tests of multi-factor ranking
# systems. You can use an existing ranking system that we offer or a ranking system 
# that you have created on the website. It is also possible to define the ranking
# system within the DataMiner script. Other settings include the number of buckets,
# the rebalance period, and the starting universe. The DataMiner output includes
# many more statistics than what the website offers. To collect these stats, DataMiner
# runs a screen backtest for each bucket.

# Below is a sample script and output from a 10-year test of two ranking systems we 
# offer, "Core: Growth" and "Core: Value". It divides the universe (stocks on the Nasdaq
# exchange) into five buckets based on the stocks rank and compares the returns for
# the stocks in those buckets to the returns of the universe and the benchmark. 
# The Iterations section determines which ranking systems are tested. The 'Name' is
# free form text you use to describe details of that iteration which will be used
# as a heading in the output. The 'Ranking' is the name of the ranking system being tested.
