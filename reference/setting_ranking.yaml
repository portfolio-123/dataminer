# Ranking definition
# 
# There are four ways to specify the Ranking

# 1) Using an existing ranking ranking system. 
# Can be one of our pre-defined systems or yours.
# By name or by it's unique id.
Ranking: 'Core: Value'  # use quotes if name has ':'
# or
Ranking: 12345


# 2) By specifying the Nodes in the xml format used on our website.
Ranking:
    Nodes: in xml format
    Method: NAsNegative #( [NAsNegative] | NAsNeutral )

# 3) By specifying the Nodes explicitly using user friendly syntax
Ranking:
    Rank: Higher # ( [Higher] | Lower | Summation )
    Method: NAsNegative #( [NAsNegative] | NAsNeutral )
    Nodes: see setting_ranking_nodes.yaml
    
# 4) By specifying a Quick Rank formula (only valid in screen operations )
Ranking:
    Formula: MktCap # Enter quick rank formula
    Lower is Better: true # ( true | [false] )
    
# NOTES 
# For (2) & (3) a ranking system called APIRankingSystem will be created.
# This ranking system will be reused by the API and will always contain the
# version specified by the last iteration of the API operation
